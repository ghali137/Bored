I have developed this app to make a simple yet surprisingly powerful note-taking app. It is used to organize notes in boxes, each note being a box itself.
This means you can put a list of notes inside each note you have taken.
The only call-to-action is the add note button, and every note is a button itself.
This approach to note-taking makes navigating around the app incredibly intuitive.
